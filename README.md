# Jar_files

### All these java files are dedicated to find Maximum Temperature from a given unsorted data. (Please check your schema before conducting the jobs as these were written on some other data schema).

Here is a repository which has various java files that conducts a MapReduce job using:
* Driver File
* Mapper File
* Reducer File
Basically all the Mappers and Reducers are driven by single driver files i.e. MaxTemperature.java.

#### MaxTemperature_comp.java is a kind of file where the input file is compressed by the Mapper class and the Reduced.
